#C++ Solutions

*Note: Work in progress.*

You can build the solutions using CMake:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Each solution executable prints Usage information if executed with no additional arguments.

See respective folders for additional instructions on how to run the examples.


**TODO**

- Unify function / variable naming style
- Explore C++11 `auto_ptr` and `shared_ptr` for better memory managment practices
- Explore C++11 move constructor for more efficient object passing
- Explore options for implementation of in-place algorithms while maintaining the paradigm of immutable objects in the sense of input parameter defensive copying on construction.
